Your notes (your puzzle input) consist of two lines. The first line is your estimate of the earliest timestamp you could depart on a bus. The second line lists the bus IDs that are in service according to the shuttle company; entries that show x must be out of service, so you decide to ignore them.

To save time once you arrive, your goal is to figure out the earliest bus you can take to the airport. (There will be exactly one such bus.)

For example, suppose you have the following notes:

939
7,13,x,x,59,x,31,19

Here, the earliest timestamp you could depart is 939, and the bus IDs in service are 7, 13, 59, 31, and 19. Near timestamp 939, these bus IDs depart at the times marked D:


puzzle 2


An x in the schedule means there are no constraints on what bus IDs must depart at that time.

This means you are looking for the earliest timestamp (called t) such that:

    Bus ID 7 departs at timestamp t.
    Bus ID 13 departs one minute after timestamp t.
    There are no requirements or restrictions on departures at two or three minutes after timestamp t.
    Bus ID 59 departs four minutes after timestamp t.
    There are no requirements or restrictions on departures at five minutes after timestamp t.
    Bus ID 31 departs six minutes after timestamp t.
    Bus ID 19 departs seven minutes after timestamp t.
