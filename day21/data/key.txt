You start by compiling a list of foods (your puzzle input), one food per line. Each line includes that food's ingredients list followed by some or all of the allergens the food contains.

Each allergen is found in exactly one ingredient. Each ingredient contains zero or one allergen. Allergens aren't always marked; when they're listed (as in (contains nuts, shellfish) after an ingredients list), the ingredient that contains each listed allergen will be somewhere in the corresponding ingredients list. However, even if an allergen isn't listed, the ingredient that contains that allergen could still be present: maybe they forgot to label it, or maybe it was labeled in a language you don't know.
